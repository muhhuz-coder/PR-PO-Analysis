# Company Dashboard Analysis

This repository showcases a **Power BI** dashboard I created for analyzing key metrics of one of the largest Power Companies . The dashboard provides insights into various operational KPIs, such as PR analysis, spend distribution, PO efficiency, and more.

### Features:
- **TAT Analysis**: Breakdown of turnaround time by supervisor and buyer.
- **PR Analysis**: Analysis of Purchase Requests by various categories like plant, buyer, and requisition.
- **Spend Analysis**: Detailed spend against priority, contractual vs non-contractual POs, and purchaser performance.
